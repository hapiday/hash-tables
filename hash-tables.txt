Exercises:

1. What is a hash table?

-A type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs, just like JavaScript objects.

2. What is hashing?

-The conversion from a string to a numerical index.

3. How does a hash table store data?

-Takes a key which can be any data type. The key is converted to a integer(hash code) operated by a hash function. Calculates a true index by modding the key to its capacity. Store the value in the calculated array bin

4. How are hash tables and objects different?

-If your data is a static number of distinct values of different types, then an object is the optimal choice. Use a hash table when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier.

5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
-A list of pets and their unique names.

6.Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

var phoneNumber = new HashTable();
  phoneNumber.add('6262890000', {Name: 'Sara Kang', Address: '2345 Bush St'});
  phoneNumber.add('6263451288', {Name: 'Paul Kang', Address: '167 Prospect Ave'});
  phoneNumber.lookup('6262890000')

7.Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

var inventory = new HashTable();
  inventory.add('534', {Name: 'Ibuprofen', Price:'4.00'});
  inventory.add('535, {Name: 'Acetaminophen', Price:'4.00'});
  inventory.lookup('534')

8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

let newsPaper = new HashTable();

  newsPaper.add('SF Chronicle 01/20/19', {Title: 'Thousands rally for justice at Womenâ€™s March in SF', Link: 'https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Thousands-rally-for-rights-at-Women-s-March-in-13547251.php'});

  newsPaper.add('Los Angeles Times 01/19/19', {Title: 'On the Texas-Mexico border: Crisis? What crisis?', Published: '6:05 PM, January 19, 2019', Link: 'https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-border-trump-crisis-20190119-story.html'});

  console.log(news.lookup("SF Chronicle 01/20/19"));
  console.log(news.lookup("Los Angeles Times 01/19/19"));
